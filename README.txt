Getting Started

Note: The easiest way to run Usergrid is to download the double-clickable jar
at:

https://usergrid.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Usergrid%20Nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/org.usergrid$usergrid-launcher/artifact/org.usergrid/usergrid-launcher/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

This will let you try out the system without building or installing it.

Requirements

JDK 1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)

Building

Download and install Maven using the instructions on the Apache Maven website,
then, from the command line, go to the usergrid directory and type the
following:

mvn install

This will cause Maven to download and install all the necessary dependencies.
This also runs a small set of tests after compilation, however these tests do
start up an instance of Cassandra. To run the build without all the tests
being fired, use the following:

mvn install -DskipTests=true

If you don't want to do a full build, you can download a pre-built version
of the launcher app from:

https://usergrid.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Usergrid%20Nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/org.usergrid$usergrid-launcher/artifact/org.usergrid/usergrid-launcher/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Running

Usergrid-core contains the persistence layer and shared utilities for powering
the Usergrid service. The services layer is contained in usergrid-services and
exposes a higher-level API that's used by the usergrid-rest web services tier.

You can run Usergrid from the command-line from the
jar in the usergrid/standalone project:

java -jar standalone/target/usergrid-standalone-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

After startup, your instance will be available on localhost, port 8080.
To check itâ€™s running properly, you can try loading our status page:
http://localhost:8080/status

You can also run it as a webapp in Tomcat, by deploying the ROOT.war
file generated in the usergrid/rest project,
